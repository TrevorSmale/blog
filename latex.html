        <h2> A markup language for better typesetting </h2>

        <p> If you are reading this document, then you are likely looking for greater control over your long form
            documents. Markup languages are the logical choice for such work. Markup refers to the
            plain text with 'Markup' indicating all formatting decisions. Latex is a markup language that enables
            detailed markup, giving full control over typesetting and layout beyond the capabilities of a traditional
            'WYSIWYG' editor. </p>
        <p> What you see is what you get (wysiwyg) pronounced wiz-ee-wig editors present a document format while
            writing, an advantageous feature when whipping up simple documents like reports, letters and short essays.
            Markup languages differ, as all typesetting and other stylistic choices are
            visible in the form of tags. Markup documents are compiled into final layouts once writing and tagging is
            complete. p language that enables fine control over typesetting and layout. </p>

        <p> Anyone who has drafted longer documents with a lot of inline formatting has noticed wrinkles in the
            formatting that cannot be ironed out easily. Furthermore, including footnotes, tables, images and
            bibliographic
            references have running into using plug ins or third party tools to reduce formatting errors and decrease
            the amount of tweaks needed. Almost everyone has experienced ghost indentations that skew the whole
            document, requiring a literal bug hunt. </p>

        <p> Markup writing languages solve these issues by having clear and present formatting that can be proceduraly
            debugged. </p>

        <h2> Element labelling </h2>

        <p> latex every element is labelled, this enables the 'compiler' to identify the formatting for each label. For
            example a title is labeled with <code> \title{example} </code>. </p>
