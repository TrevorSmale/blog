<h2> A markup language for better typesetting </h2>

<p> What you see is what you get (wysiwyg) pronounced wiz-ee-wig editors are word processors that present the final output while editing. Markup languages differ, as all typesetting and other stylistic choices are visible in the form of tags. Markup documents are compiled into final layouts once writing and tagging is complete. </p>

<p>We are all familiar with WYSIWYG editors like MS word, pages or Libreoffice. Wysiwyg was a revolutionary technology during the desktop publishing boom of the 1970â€™s. It meant a lower barrier of entry to a massively growing market of personal computer users. It introduced an interactive visual workflow, allowing for button based adjustments and instant rendering. </p>

<p> However, anyone who has drafted longer documents with a lot of inline formatting has noticed wrinkles appearing that cannot be ironed out. Furthermore, including footnotes, tables, images and bibliographic references have running into using plug ins or third party tools to reduce formatting errors and decrease the amount of tweaks needed. Almost everyone has experienced ghost indentations that skew the whole document, requiring a literal bug hunt. </p>
