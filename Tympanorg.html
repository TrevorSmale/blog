        <h2> Description </h2>

        <p> The Tympan project is an Open group project aspiring to design and standardize a free and open hearing aid /
            Audiology tester platform.</p>

        <h2> The Story </h2>

        <p> Until very recently, assistive technologies for hearing loss were out of reach due to high costs and complex
            fitting/tuning procedures. Now, due to the convergence of low cost open source micro electronics and
            skillful altruistic developers, there exists the Tympan project. A team of highly skilled individuals have
            created a universal hearing aid platform using relatively simple and accessible parts. project Tympan has
            developed a small device that hangs around the neck rather than sit in the ear. Audio is captured through an
            inbuilt microphone, then amplified and modulated to suite the hearing profile of the user. The audio output
            signal is either played through run of the mill headphones or transmitted via bluetooth. </p>

        <p> Hearing loss is a broadly experienced phenomenon, afflicting people of all ages. It is my hope that this
            project reaches more eyes. If you are looking to endorse a simple project that can have an enormously
            positive effect, please visit the official tympan project website. </p>
