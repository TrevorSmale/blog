        <h2> My github notes </h2>

        <p> I started learning Github along with some new technical skills recently. Along the way I have picked up techniques and ideas that were not quite clear at first. I created this page as reference for myself with hopes that it will be useful for others. </p>
        <p> It all started in the browser with a hardware project. I had heard about version control from colleagues and wanted to apply the concept to hardware. Design, especially CADD design is becoming more procedural, and conrolling design revisions is important with 
            assemblies. So I created a Git account and started trying to jam a square peg in a round hole </p>
        <p> I would later learn that git can be operated more locally and pushed with a brief connection, this idea was really intriguing as I dream of doing remote work more effectively. This idea pushed me into learning more terminal / commandline stuff with fundamentals in mind. It eventually paid off because I am now moving and shaking with Git. </p>
        <p> Its not essential to learn terminal commands for git as most IDE's can sync to version control with button presses, but damn things are faster and more fluid with understanding terminal commands. I can create folders with <code> mkdir </code> start blank files with <code> touch 'foldername1', 'foldername2' </code> and poke around inside of files with VIM </p>
        <p> When working in the terminal it is vital to first generate an SSH Key for ease of use, there are instructions published <code> Here </code> on Githubs website. The same idea applies to other Git platforms like Gitlab, SSH keys are cryptographic keys used to authenticate a user, like a more sophisticated password.
