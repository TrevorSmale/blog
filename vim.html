<h2> An extensible CLI text editor </h2>

<p> VIM is a terminal based text editor used to quickly access and modify files using only a limited number of keystrokes. Understanding VIM and its keybindings can and will improve your programming, scripting and writing by way of improvements to your speed and fluidity. I have been using VIM and VIM keybindings for over a year now and have a rather positive impression worth a write up.</p> 

<p>The thoughtful simplicity of its architecture allows for unbeatable speed, this aspect continues to draw appreciation from efficiency focused users. For over 40 years, VIM has remained a top contender among feature rich extensible text editors, eschewing bloat and conserving speed.</p>

<p> software has evolved from humble beginnings as Vi, a text editor created by Bill Joy for the Unix Operating system, later to be copied. VIM was an open source copy of Bill Joy’ Vi, allowing for further growth in a broader development community. More recently NeoVIM has been created as a more modernized version of the system, allowing for more extensibility. </p>
    
<p> There are many versions, copies and interpretations of the Vi system architecture as a consequence of being open source. On Unix type systems, VIM is a trivial install through the command line. On Windows systems, vim involves more steps with slightly less functional fluidity. </p>

<h2> Getting Started </h2>

<p> Once installed and launched, one is confronted with a basic terminal window. Welcome to your new minimal interface, or lack thereof, presenting one with the first hurdle: Inserting, Escaping, Saving and Quitting. Something we all know how to do visually with a few clicks, yet VIM is notoriously confusing, prompting jokes about accessing the most basic of functions. VIM only uses keyboard shortcuts with few modifier keys, (I) for Insert, (Esc) to exit writing mode, (:w) to write a file and finally (:q) to quit, Bizarre, I know, yet functionally it took fewer steps while never reaching for the mouse. </p>

<p> VIM will seem alien to those who are used to a visual, button based interface, It will be non intuitive, requiring the memorization of text functions and key movements, devoid of all modern visual interface. Yet, given some introductory learning and some conceptual re-framing, VIM starts to feel like the wiser choice for someone who is going to be editing multiple documents simultaneously. I must warn you, the rabbit hole goes very deep on VIM, the more one can remember, the more efficiently one can wrangle files more effectively, to some that can an addictive cycle. There are functional shortcuts for every editing function under the sun, it just takes time to learn and many instances to remember. </p>

<p> VIM tutor is where everyone starts. After one has installed or accessed VIM, typing vimtutor in most versions will bring up a sort of text based game that introduces a large amount of concepts in progressive modules. The VIM tutor says that one is capable of making it through the tutorial in 30 mins, I found it to takes much longer with the amount of experimentation that takes place with each stage. Vimtutor is also something to revisit, as some of the more complex functions are harder to memorize if not used. </p>

<p> I was originally introduced to the concept of using such lightweight text editors by Luke Smith, a linguist who enhances his craft through the utilization of VIM among other tools. I found his explanation of the efficacy of VIM to be broadly convincing and well articulated, though somewhat complex at first. Furthermore, once I had completed VIM tutor along with some youtube Pep talks, I was up an running, editing scripts and writing technical documentation with greater ease. As a fairly quick ten finger typist, I find the use of VIM to be so fluid now, opening and editing is almost naturally reflexive. </p>

<p> Now that I have the basics, with a year of practice under my belt, I am looking to expand my capabilities with VIM by watching tutorials created by the energetic ThePrimeagen, someone who I find very informative and clear.  I will be writing follow up postings in regards to the development of a writing workflow using VIM for technical documentation. I hope you have found this article helpful. </p>
