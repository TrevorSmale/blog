<h2> Milestones in Industry </h2>
<h3> A pretext of industry </h3>

<h4> 1.0 Steam powered factories - A brief history of manufacturing </h4>

<p> The basic model of manufacturing is part of the broader first industrial revolution, which came into being throughout the british empire during the turn of the 19th century. A perfect storm of locomotion, urbanization and free market economics amongst other factors lead to the mass production of inexpensive goods, creating new markets amongst the middle and lower classes, who could now afford to have previously un attainable goods. This revolution is considered to be the first of four major milestones in manufacturing technology. The concept of early manufacturing was simple, Simplify objects into their most essential form and produce them in large batches to reduce cost. Factories ran on coal or oil to produce steam, a large hot noisy and volatile source of energy. Factories would transfer power from a single source, harnessing and distributing that energy throughout the factories using belts, pulleys, chains and cogs. Craftsmen were employed to tend to several production positions depending on what was needed that day. </p>

<h4> 2.0 Mass production </h4>

<p> Around the turn of the 20th Century, electricity, a clean, quiet and manageable form of energy had taken over as a primary means for energy transmission, allowing for cleaner, safer and more controllable machinery.  The division of labour within factories meant that less skilled workers could be utilized by giving each person a simple task. By this time mandatory schooling was standard and modelled to resemble the factory setting. Along with improvements in industrial management and material processing, the second industrial revolution created a massive, unskilled workforce, lifting an untold number of people from poverty and creating a diverse competitive economy of goods.</p>

<h4> 3.0 Automation </h4>

<p> Now at the end of the 20th century, manufacturing has become refined and sophisticated. Supplying for and competing in the global marketplace has forced manufacturers to closely asses efficiency.  Material supply chains, labour forces and products must be finely tuned in order to remain competitive. The microprocessor, has led to computational methods of design and management enabling close tracking and observation of the process from beginning to end. The microprocessor has also led to the automation of machinery, eliminating a large portion of low skilled labour and the demand for highly skilled, specialized labour grows.</p>

<p> manufacturing industries are fundamentally similar to the principles of the early revolution. We extract available raw materials from the ground mostly. We use large amounts of energy to extract, refine and process materials into the semi modular forms we require for eventual alteration and distribute produced goods through logistical networks. This pattern of extract, refine, produce and distribute is here to stay. It the the common denominator of all manufacturing. However, the ways in which we extract or where will extract from will certainly change. The refining of materials can only become more complex yet efficient as we will require more purified materials for more sophisticated processes. The means of production and distribution will change most dramatically in relation to the other aspects of industry. <p>

<h3> 4.0 Data driven production </h3>

<p> The 4th revolution in industry is upon us. The picture of how exactly the 4th wave will unfold is unclear. Large industries are researching and revisioning how to effectively incorporate these new ideas and are innovating methodologies on a daily basis. I created this article to compile my own ruminations on this general subject and give a broad overview of the disruptive technologies that will shape this next great leap in manufacturing for others to reference or constructively critique. </p>

<h4> Object as data </h4>

<p> According to futurist Ray Kurzweil, Process like 3D printing that can materialize objects from mere data are going to cause a major disruptions in all areas of manufacturing. </p>
