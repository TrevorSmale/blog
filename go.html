                <h3> About </h3>

                <p> Go is a statically typed compiled language touted as 'C for the 21st century' due in part to its
                development taking place after the advent of the internet, distributed databases and compute, as well as large organizational engineering projects. 

               <p> Initial development took place between Rob pike (C/UTF 8) Robert Griesemer (Hotspot JVM) Ken Thompson (Unix/Bsd) at Google
                starting in 2007. They were trying to solve a fundamental problem google was facing, many languages and frameworks were needed to maintain the large distributed computing
                infrastructure google had and a singular language was needed that could handle a broad range of new tasks. Human readable syntax, Memory locality and Concurrency were top of the priority list. </p>

    <h3> Features of Golang </h3>

                <p> <strong>Concurrency </strong> - Allowing for many tasks to virtually run in parellel </p>
                
                <p> <strong> Distribituted Systems </strong> - Many devices accross many networks </p>
                
                <p> <strong> Garbage Collection </strong> - Erasing memory loops </p>
                
                <p> <strong> Memory Locality </strong> - Specifying memory pools </p>
                
                <p> <strong> Readability </strong> - Much easier to comprehend the intent of the program </p>
