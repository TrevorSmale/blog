<h4> About </h4>

is a statically typed compiled language touted as 'C for the 21st century' due in part to its development taking place after the advent of the internet and distributed computing.

<h4> Initial Development </h4>

Took place between Rob pike (C/UTF 8) Robert Griesemer (Hotspot JVM) Ken Thompson (Unix/Bsd) at Google starting in 2007. Many languages and frameworks were needed to maintain the large distributed computing infrastructure google had. There was a desire for a modern language that could handle just about anything.

<h4>Go's 21st Century Characteristics </h4>

<li> Concurrency </li>
<li> Distribituted Systems </li>
<li> Garbage Collection </li>
<li> Memory Locality </li>
<li> Readability </li>

## Progressive Web

### Build procedure
Using 

go-app is a package to build progressive web apps (PWA) with Go programming language and WebAssembly.
It uses a declarative syntax that allows creating and dealing with HTML elements only by using Go, and without writing any HTML markup.
The package also provides an http.handler ready to serve all the required resources to run Go-based progressive web apps.
Install

go-app requirements:

Go 1.14 or newer
Go module

```
# Init go module (if not initialized):
go mod init

# Get package:
go get -u -v github.com/maxence-charriere/go-app/v6
```

Users: The users of your app. They request pages and resources from their web browser.

app.Handler: An http.Handler used by your server or cloud function. It serves your app, its static resources, and all the required files to make it work on user browsers.

Application: Your app built with this package. It is built as a WebAssembly (.wasm) binary and is served by the app.Handler.

Other static resources: Styles, images, and scripts used by your app. They are also served by the app.Handler.

Declarative syntax

go-app uses a declarative syntax so you can write component-based UI elements just by using the Go programming language.

<code>
package main

import "github.com/maxence-charriere/go-app/v6/pkg/app"

type hello struct {
    app.Compo
    name string
}

func (h *hello) Render() app.UI {
    return app.Div().Body(
        app.Main().Body(
            app.H1().Body(
                app.Text("Hello, "),
                app.If(h.name != "",
                    app.Text(h.name),
                ).Else(
                    app.Text("World"),
                ),
            ),
            app.Input().
                Value(h.name).
                Placeholder("What is your name?").
                AutoFocus(true).
                OnChange(h.OnInputChange),
        ),
    )
}

func (h *hello) OnInputChange(src app.Value, e app.Event) {
    h.name = src.Get("value").String()
    h.Update()
}

func main() {
    app.Route("/", &hello{})
    app.Route("/hello", &hello{})
    app.Run()
}
