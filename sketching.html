            <h2> Intro </h2>

            <p> Drawing or sketching involves some great skill. Exercise your ability to draw and unlock hidden
                potential in your ability to analyze and translate visual information. It may be a slow, rough start,
                but don’t let that stop you from expanding your skill set. </p>

            <p> Let us start with what constitutes a sketch. It is a rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not
                usually intended as a finished work as defined by Wikipedia. </p>

            <p> We all know that sketching is a skill normally acquired by artists during early formal training. Some of
                us are just environmentally predisposed to being attracted to creative expression, particular, with a
                visual medium. However, this discipline is more accessible than one may think. To me, sketching is an
                analytical pursuit toward a measure of importance. The analysis being the clarification of important
                elements. what makes the element important is one part logical/analytical and one part subjective
                interpretation. You must ask yourself, What strokes or hatches will be needed in order to describe my
                subject? </p>

            <p> Manet elegantly proposes the minimal raw elements most important for describing his subject, see
                Expressionism if you like this. In the image below, The small smudge representing the mans pipe is most
                indicative of this minimal expression. Manet had to decide what clear signals (signifiers) would denote
                that this smudge was a pipe. It requires a holistic interpretation of the whole sketch to deduce ‘pipe’.
                More specifically, the distance that smudge extends from the mans mouth in relation to his posture etc..
                would suggest further it was a pipe. This case should exemplify how we exercise our decision making
                skills when we determine our plan for a drawing. Where to start with a rough plan, determine points of
                focus and stop, at an undetermined point of completeness. </p>

            <p> Our lives are filled with rich visual information, increasingly so, given We are bombarded with visual
                media. We are heavy consumers of rich visual experiences, yet, we produce little from the
                visualizations. We internalize, analyze and re-configure imagery in our imaginations but have trouble
                expressing it visually. An interesting project Deep Dream is looking into this kind of image cognition
                and interpretation. An interesting way of seeing this cognition take place is by observing children’s
                drawings. Children posses a limited concrete understanding of the world and therefore a lack of
                inhibition when in comes to creative exploration. </p>

            <p> Observe the sketch below of the man in the hammock, I believe it perfectly encapsulates the essence of
                how sketching can transcend what is seen and explore what is imagined, all the while communicating to
                the viewer, pertinent information. The sketch below was taken from one of Victor A. Lundys’ sketchbooks.
                This drawing was done during his down time from service. </p>

            <p> Designers and visual communicators understand sketching is a powerful medium and communication tool. A
                large number of us just don’t see any merit in learning such a skill. </p>

            <p> Historically, before the invention of the camera, sketching was seen as not only a method for
                imaginative expression, but as a scientific tool for capturing pertinent visual data. This importance is
                still evident in courtrooms where cameras are sometimes prohibited. </p>

            <p> People in general have given up Landing pencil to paper and hashing ideas out in favor of seemingly more
                efficient methods of communication. The trend away from hand drafted communication has of course been
                made scarce by high efficiency digital tools and the advent of camera culture (ubiquitous photography).
            </p>

            <p> Telling yourself or anyone else that you can’t draw is an omission of confidence. It is purely an unjust
                frame of mind to think one is incapable of even drawing stick people. The anthropomorphous
                characteristics of five lines and a circle are not such a daunting task, we see the human form everyday.
            </p>

            <p> Unlike other forms of exploring an idea using visual methods, sketching unlocks alternative processes in
                the brain that work in unique and different ways. Additionally, it is an excellent way to re-strengthen
                long lost motor cortex connections that may benefit other hand/eye coordination skills. </p>

            <p> Sketching is a lot more free and fluid than we are taught. Children learn at school by copying or
                following a set plan. Teachers then objectively evaluate the child's accuracy. Drawing inside the lines,
                iconography/photography work is how we learn drawing is done. </p>

            <p> Using reference is only a part of true sketching, we are actually capable of referencing imagined
                visualizations, constructed from experiences and then translating them into real visual experiences once
                again. Try doodling the next time you have an idea, keep it to yourself and treat it like a visual Que,
                rather than a fully formed idea. If you treat your sketches like visual notes rather than serious
                artistic endeavors, you will gain </p>
