        <h1> Blender </h1>

        <img src="img/Blender.svg" style="width:200px;height:200px;">

        <h2> &#129488; Description </h2>

        <p> Blender is an Open Source software package for creating 3D models and animations. Originally created by Ton
            Roosendaal as a fledgling modelling program, it has grown into a massively popular full featured suite with
            a physical headquarter building in Amsterdam. Thanks to the open nature of both the software and passionate
            community surrounding it, Blender has grown into such a capable toolset that it now stands toe to toe with
            major commercial software. Furthermore, the software is now being implemented into customized professional
            pipelines for film and animation. Outside of entertainment the software is now used in scientific research
            projects. </p>

        <h2> &#128077; My Fav </h2>

        <p> My history with Blender began when working in a group project involving input electronics and Unity in
            (2011) we needed to create a virtual interface with unique physical inputs (Arduino). We created some UI
            elements and 3D objects using Blender and integrated those assets into the game Engine Unity, the process
            was difficult given the software and skills of the group at the time. From that project on, I rarely used
            the software and focused on mainly technical design software. Fast forward to the release of Blender 2.8
            Beta in 2019 when I went 'All in' on learning to use it. I had already gained expertise with Nurbs modelling
            and wanted to integrate Rhino 3D, a really good NURBS design tool. </p>

        <h2> &#8644; Development </h2>

        <p> The pace of development is feverish, there are so many inbuilt features, plugins and mods, that it seems
            like less of a singular program and more like an operating system capable of almost any visualization. </p>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <p>I am sure you are convinced that Blender is more than capable of handling your next project. So how does one
            get started? Due to the functional extensibility of this vast suite of tools, the learning curve to getting
            started can seem steep. However, there are virtually limitless learning materials including thousands of
            hours of video training on YouTUbe. It is important to note that it is easy to become overwhelmed due to the
            variety of choice, so focus on a particular project you would like to accomplish and try to map a procedure
            for doing it. </p>
