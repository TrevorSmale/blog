<h2> Description </h2>

<hr>

Blender is an Open Source software tool for creating 3D models and animations. Originally created by Ton Roosendaal as a fledgling modelling program, it has grown into a massively popular full featured suite with a physical headquarter building in Amsterdam. Thanks to the open nature of both the software and passionate community surrounding it, Blender has grown into such a capable toolset that it now stands toe to toe with major commercial software. Furthermore, the software is now being implemented into customized professional pipelines for film and animation. Outside of entertainment the software is now used in scientific research projects.

<h2> I use blender often </h2>

<hr>

I had used the software for quick tasks during University Projects and Game Jams with only surface knowledge. After much preliminary research into Design software and speaking with others in my industry, came to the realization that much of the design work I had done in the past could be replicated in Blender. Moreover, I had realized that I would be able to integrate Blender with Rhino 3D, a really good NURBS design tool. Several years ago I took it upon myself to learn Blender to a level of depth where I would be comfortable with it enough to handle production work. Several years later, and I am glad with my time investment.

</br>

I have also come to realize that Blender with Plug-ins is capable of far more than I had originally anticaped and this is a fantastic bonus.

<h2> Primary Uses </h2>

<h4> Game asset production and animation </h4>

<h2> Secondary Uses </h2>

<h4>Design Rendering, Visual Simulation, Motion Graphics, Animation, Digital Sculpting</h4>

<h2> Fringe uses </h2>

<h4> Physics research, Medical research </h4>

<h2> Development </h2>

<hr>

The pace of development is feverish, there are so many inbuilt features, plugins and mods, that it seems like less of a singular program and more like an operating system capable of photo realistic everything. The efforts of the massive community have culminated into version 2.8, a very major release. In terms of overall user experience and functionality Version 2.8 represents a major milestone. 2.8 is currently in Beta and will be release near q4 2019. Never has there been a better time to get into using the software.

<h2> Contributing </h2>

<hr>

If you are not familiar with Open Source software, there is a mantra amongst fervent enthusiasts. If you are using a free, open source software, then you must contribute in some way to the cause. 

</br>
</br>

<h4> Financial Contributions </h4> The Blender Foundation accepts donations in the form of membership
<h4> Development Contributions </h4> Blender accepts edits to its software via pull request on GIT
<h4> Educational Contributions </h4> Many advanced Blender users create free educational content for aspiring users
<h4> Editorial Contributions </h4> Social Media, Blogging and Video help promote Blender

</br>
</br>

A majority of the ‘Blender Community’ have dedicated time to teaching others as a form of karmic repayment for having free access to such a powerful tool.

Below I have featured several of my favorite Blender artists who have made major educational contributions to the Blender 3D ecosystem.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<hr>

I am sure you are convinced that Blender is more than capable of handling your next project. So how does one get started? Due to the functional extensibility of this vast suite of tools, the learning curve to getting started is steep. However, there are virtually limitless materials relating to a multitude of stylistic endeavours. Extensive tutorials are available to purchase on the websites of the artists I have listed above. Moreover, head on over to youtube, blender market or gumtroad to find even more material. I can’t
