<h2> &#129488; Description </h2>

<hr>

Blender is an Open Source software tool for creating 3D models and animations. Originally created by Ton Roosendaal as a fledgling modelling program, it has grown into a massively popular full featured suite with a physical headquarter building in Amsterdam. Thanks to the open nature of both the software and passionate community surrounding it, Blender has grown into such a capable toolset that it now stands toe to toe with major commercial software. Furthermore, the software is now being implemented into customized professional pipelines for film and animation. Outside of entertainment the software is now used in scientific research projects.

<h2> &#128077; My Fav </h2>

<hr>

My history with Blender began when working in a group project involving input electronics and Unity in (2011) we needed to create a virtual interface with unique physical inputs (Arduino). We created some UI elements and 3D objects using Blender and integrated those assets into the game Engine Unity, the process was difficult given the software and skills of the group at the time. From that project on, I rarely used the software and focused on mainly technical design software. Fast forward to the release of Blender 2.8 Beta in 2019 when I went 'All in' on learning to use it. I had already gained expertise with Nurbs modelling and wanted to integrate Rhino 3D, a really good NURBS design tool.

<h2> &#8644; Development </h2>

<hr>

The pace of development is feverish, there are so many inbuilt features, plugins and mods, that it seems like less of a singular program and more like an operating system capable of almost any visualization.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<hr>

I am sure you are convinced that Blender is more than capable of handling your next project. So how does one get started? Due to the functional extensibility of this vast suite of tools, the learning curve to getting started can seem steep. However, there are virtually limitless learning materials including thousands of hours of video training on YouTUbe. It is important to note that it is easy to become overwhelmed due to the variety of choice, so focus on a particular project you would like to accomplish and try to map a procedure for doing it.

<h2> &#9996; Procedural Notes </h2>

<hr>

<h4> Rhino &#8644; Blender export process </h4>

<h4> 1. Model Prep in Rhino 3D V7 </h4>

<hr>

Firstly our target is exporting an OBJ file from Rhino. There are a few options that need to be chosen for sanity in Blender.

<br>
<br>

<strong> OBJ Export Settings </strong>

<br>
<br>

<h4> A) Export to PolyGon Mesh Objects

<br>
<br>

<h4> B) Export as OBJ groups (Used for 3Ds Max)

<br>
<br>

<h4> C) Welded Mesh

<br>
<br>

<h4> 2. Import </h4>

<hr>

File > Import > OBJ

<br>
<br>

<h4> 3. Scaling </h4>

<hr>

Once the model is import, scale down the objects from (Object Scale) 1.000 &#8644; 0.001

<br>
<br>

<h4> 4. Split </h4>

<hr>

Sometimes the model will import into a single merged object. In this case, one must go into 'Edit' mode, select all faces and 'seperate by loose parts'.
This will seperate all of the discrete parts into individual scene objects.

<br>
<br>

<h4> 5. Decimate </h4>

<hr>

A VFX Artist named Blender Bob created a great tutorial on processing imported assets wherein the Decimation modifier is used with the 'planar' function to create nice clean faces for further meshwork like retopology.

<br>
<br>

<h4> 6. Remesh </h4>

<hr>

Depending on the level of visual accuracy you wish to attain, you can quickly quadremesh for low quality and manually retopologize for models requiring high accuracy.
