Blender is an Open Source software for creating 3D models and animations most commonly seen in games and movies. Originally created by Ton Roosendaal as a fledgling modelling program, it has grown into a massively popular tool. Thanks to the open nature of both the software and passionate community surrounding it, Blender has grown into such a capable beast that it now stands toe to toe with major commercial offerings, most notably Autodesk’ Maya. 
Blender is excellent for:
Industrial Design rendering

Visual Simulation

Motion Graphics

Animation

Digital Sculpting

Architectural rendering

The pace of development is feverish, there are so many inbuilt features, plugins and mods, that it seems like less of a singular program and more like an operating system capable of photo realistic everything. The efforts of the massive community have culminated into version 2.8, a very major release. In terms of overall user experience and functionality Version 2.8 represents a major milestone. 2.8 is currently in Beta and will be release near q4 2019. Never has there been a better time to get into using the software.

If you are not familiar with Open Source software, there is a mantra amongst fervent enthusiasts. If you are using a free, open source software, then you must contribute in some way to the cause. There are many ways to contribute, financially, programatically, educationally or editorially. A majority of the ‘Blender Community’ have dedicated time to teaching others as a form of karmic repayment for having free access to such a powerful tool. Below I have featured several of my favorite Blender artists who have made major educational contributions to the Blender 3D ecosystem.

I am sure you are convinced that Blender is more than capable of handling your next project. So how does one get started? Due to the functional extensibility of this vast suite of tools, the learning curve to getting started is steep. However, there are virtually limitless materials relating to a multitude of stylistic endeavours. Extensive tutorials are available to purchase on the websites of the artists I have listed above. Moreover, head on over to youtube, blender market or gumtroad to find even more material. I can’t wait to see more people utilizing the software so that the community will grow even faster.
