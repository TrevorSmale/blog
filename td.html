<h1> Technical Documentation </h1>

Documentation can always use improvement. There are many behavioral reasons for anemic, disjointed or a-symmetric project documentation, for that I have nothing. Though I can suggest some tools and methodologies for improving your last minute rush to document a project.

Firstly, using a ‘What you see you is what you get’ (WYSIWYG) editor is no good in by books. Microsoft Word, Pages, Google Docs, all create hidden formatting information that is bound to proprietary file formats that are susceptible to corruption in exchange. This leads to my first tip:

</br>

<h4> 1) Use a Plain Text Markup language </h4> 
By plain text, I mean text that is excluding visual formatting, a simple example of plain text formatting would be bolding text. In plain text it would be marked up like * this *, the stars designate a format to be rendered like this.

</br>

<h4> 2) ASCIIDOC is my favorite </h4> 
Assciidoc is a plain text markup language. unlike Mark-Down or HTML, it is a format designed for technical documentation. There is limited information on the internet in regards to the format.

</br>

<h4> 3) I suggest utilizing ASCIIDOCTOR </h4> 
Asciidoctor is a system of documentation and software tools that improves the technical documentation workflow. for example, plain text markup languages are rendered separately from the typing workspace, Asciidoctor has one plugin that will render your work live while working.

</br>

<h4> 4) Write your documentation in an IDE </h4> 
An integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software tool normally used for programming. Some of the tools that IDE’ offer greatly enhance to the plain text markup workflow. I use VIM and ATOM.IO to create and manipulate documentation files.

</br>

<h4> 5) Underestimate your Reader </h4> 
Assume that your reader will be missing vital chunks of fundamental information necessary to understating your project. Describe technical terms as if they are being introduced for the first time. This mind set may not always be practical, yet in my experience it has been.

</br>

<h4> 6) Improve upon examples </h4> 
Find examples of technical documentation that you find useful or digestible and try to answer why it stands out as more pertinent to understand than other examples.

</br>

<h4> 7) Save Snippets of Documentation </h4> 
Technical documentation can be very repetitive, so saving verbiage for re-use is a major efficiency booster. IDE power users can achieve this by using search functions  along with a few memorized key strokes.

</br>

<h4> 8) Don’t forget the README file </h4> 
In technical parlance, the READ ME file is the touchstone for a project, it typical offers up a Table of Contents along with way-finding information among other more minute details. Whether you are archiving a small collection of files, or a massive Git project, the READ ME is essential to orienting a newcomer to your documentation.

</br>

<h4> 9) Always Link when possible </h4> 
In a world of hypertext, linking is one of the best tools for efficiency. Go to any Wikipedia page and you will see a link laden landscape of text. We all know how it enables us to dig into relevant information more quickly, so take the extra time to link to relevant information.
