        <h1> Secure Shell </h1>

        <h2> Description </h2>

        <p> The Secure Shell Language was created by the Open BSD foundation to allows for highly secure communication
            using complex routing techniques and cryptographic keys to enable remote access of host computers. </p>

        <h2> Terminal Required </h2>

        <p> Terminal is a text command interface available on UNIX like systems. It enables written commands to effect
            every function of the computer. Generating and accessing SSH key data requires use of the terminal. If this
            is the first time you are reading about the terminal I suggest that you read or watch a short tutorial on
            using your specific terminal before attempting SSH key generation. </p>

        <h2> SSH is needed </h2>

        <p> SSH enables trusted communication to devices on the internet. It creates a trusted key-pair that acts as an
            identifyable fingerprint for trusted exchange. This is especially important with GitHub where many users are
            accessing a remote server to contribute changes. </p>

        <h2> Further Notes </h2>

        <p>Open SSH Normally runs Port 22, but can be configured to run on other ports</p>
        <p>The path to a remote server is normaly complex with many ports and routers to pass through</p>
        <p>Troubleshooting a bad connection can be really difficult</p>
        <p>It is important to know the version of OpenSSH you are using</p>
        <p>To install download openssh-client</p>
        <p>There is a hidden .ssh file that is contained in the home directory of a UNIX system</p>
        <p>The hidden directory contains Fingerprints and Config data used for authentication</p>
        <p>To connect remotely via SSH we must have port forwarding setup on our home router</p>
        <p>Port forwarding is blocked by ISPs sometimes, one must check the type of router they are using and
            enable/disable this feature</p>
        <p>Additional configurations must be make in order to secure remote connections, as there are many inherent
            vulnerabilities in port forwarding</p>
