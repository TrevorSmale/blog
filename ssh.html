        <h1> Secure Shell </h1>

        <h2> Description </h2>

        <p> The Secure Shell Language was created by the Open BSD foundation to allows for highly secure communication
            using complex routing techniques and cryptographic keys to enable remote access of host computers. </p>
 
	<h2> I am a noob </h2>

		<p> am not an expert on the subject of SSH, rather, I like to write about subjects I am learning in order to fully digest the information. I first came accross using SSH when I had to create a key pair in order to easily clone and commit to Git projects. I found the process mysterious and wanted to gain a better understanding. This turned out to be a deep rabit hole that I jumped down and I am glad I did. I had no idea that SSH was a robust protocal used for many secure web transactions. </p>

		<h2> SSH Mastery </h2>

		<p> Is a an excelent book written by Michael W Lucas that really goes in depth with SSH and adjacent technologies. On my journey to learn development tools I have found Michael to be a very helpful guide. Since purchasing this book, I have purchased 'Networking for System Administrators' and 'Sudo Mastery'. </p>

        <h2> Terminal Required </h2>

        <p> Terminal is a text command interface available on UNIX like systems. It enables written commands to effect
            every function of the computer. Generating and accessing SSH key data requires use of the terminal. If this
            is the first time you are reading about the terminal I suggest that you read or watch a short tutorial on
            using your specific terminal before attempting SSH key generation. </p>

        <h2> SSH is needed </h2>

        <p> SSH enables trusted communication to devices on the internet. It creates a trusted key-pair that acts as an
            identifyable fingerprint for trusted exchange. This is especially important with GitHub where many users are
            accessing a remote server to contribute changes. </p>
