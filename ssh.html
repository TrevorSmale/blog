## Generating an SSH Key

### Description

An SSH key consists of a pair of files. One is the private key, which should never be shared with anyone. The other is the public key. The other file is a public key which allows you to log into the containers and VMs you provision. When you generate the keys, you will use ```ssh-keygen``` to store the keys in a safe location so you can bypass the login prompt when connecting to your instances.
