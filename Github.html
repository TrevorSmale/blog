Adding Original Repo As an Upstream Repo
In order to pull the changes from the original repository into your forked version, you need to add the original git
repository as an upstream repository. These are the steps I followed in order to setup an offline mirror of my fork for
large repository changes in a comfy IDE.
Step 1 Open a Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac or Linux)
Step 2 Navigate to the directory that contains your forked repository
Step 3 Run the following command to list the currently configured remote repositories

git remote -v origin https://github.com/[Your UserName]/[Your Fork].

git (fetch) origin https://github.com/[Your UserName]/[Your Fork].

git (push)
Step 4 Add the original repository as an upstream repository

git remote add upstream https://github.com/[Original Owner Username]/[Original Repository].git
Step 5 If you run the git remote command again, you will now see both origin and upstream are configured

git remote -v origin https://github.com/[Your UserName]/[Your Fork].

git (fetch) origin https://github.com/[Your UserName]/[Your Fork].

git (push) upstream https://github.com/[Original Owner UserName]/[Original Repository].

git (fetch) upstream https://github.com/[Original Owner UserName]/[Original Repository].

git (push)

git fetch upstream

remote: Counting objects: 75, done.

remote: Compressing objects: 100% (53/53), done.

remote: Total 62 (delta 27), reused 44 (delta 9) Unpacking objects: 100% (62/62), done.

From https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY * [new branch] master -> upstream/master
Step 6 At this point your local branch is synced to the original repositories master branch. If you want to update the
Github repository, you need to push your changes.

$ git push origin master
Step 7 Wrap-Up

To summarize, with the 5 commands below you can sync your forked repository with the original repository and push the
changes to your Github repository.

git remote add upstream https://github.com/[Original Owner Username]/[Original Repository].git

git fetch upstream

git checkout master

git merge upstream/master

git push
