Adding Original Repo As an Upstream Repo  
In order to pull the changes from the original repository into your forked version, you need to add the original git repository as an upstream repository.  These are the steps I followed in order to setup an offline mirror of my fork for large repository changes in a comfy IDE. 
Step 1 Open a Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac or Linux)  
Step 2 Navigate to the directory that contains your forked repository  
Step 3 Run the following command to list the currently configured remote repositories    

git remote -v          origin https://github.com/[Your UserName]/[Your Fork].

git (fetch)          origin https://github.com/[Your UserName]/[Your Fork].

git (push)  
Step 4 Add the original repository as an upstream repository    

git remote add upstream https://github.com/[Original Owner Username]/[Original Repository].git  
Step 5 If you run the git remote command again, you will now see both origin and upstream are configured    

git remote -v    origin https://github.com/[Your UserName]/[Your Fork].

git (fetch)    origin https://github.com/[Your UserName]/[Your Fork].

git (push)    upstream https://github.com/[Original Owner UserName]/[Original Repository].

git (fetch)    upstream https://github.com/[Original Owner UserName]/[Original Repository].

git (push)  

git fetch upstream    

remote: Counting objects: 75, done.  

remote: Compressing objects: 100% (53/53), done.   

remote: Total 62 (delta 27), reused 44 (delta 9)   Unpacking objects: 100% (62/62), done.   

From https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY    * [new branch]      master     -> upstream/master  
Step 6 At this point your local branch is synced to the original repositories master branch. If you want to update the Github repository, you need to push your changes.    

$ git push origin master 
Step 7 Wrap-Up  

To summarize, with the 5 commands below you can sync your forked repository with the original repository and push the changes to your Github repository.    

git remote add upstream https://github.com/[Original Owner Username]/[Original Repository].git   

git fetch upstream   

git checkout master   

git merge upstream/master   

git push
